"""Notifications models (skeleton).

Scope: Notification engine: templates, channels (in-app, email, SMS, WhatsApp, web push),
preferences, quiet hours, delivery tracking.
Requirements: FR-COM-003, FR-COM-004, FR-COM-007, FR-COM-008, FR-COM-009 (FRD).

No tables yet. Tenant-owned models will combine IdMixin, TenantMixin, TimestampMixin and
AuditMixin (plus SoftDeleteMixin for people/academic records) and use tenant-scoped unique
constraints with `tenant_id` first.
