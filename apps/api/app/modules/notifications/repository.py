Scope: Notification engine: templates, channels (in-app, email, SMS, WhatsApp, web push),
preferences, quiet hours, delivery tracking.
Requirements: FR-COM-003, FR-COM-004, FR-COM-007, FR-COM-008, FR-COM-009 (FRD).

Repositories for tenant-owned models must subclass `app.common.repository.TenantRepository`;
the tenant-isolation suite fails if a tenant-owned model is queried any other way.
